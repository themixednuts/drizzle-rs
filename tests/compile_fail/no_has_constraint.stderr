error[E0277]: the trait bound `Simple: drizzle::core::HasConstraint<drizzle::core::ForeignKeyK>` is not satisfied

   = help: the trait `HasConstraint<drizzle::core::ForeignKeyK>` is not implemented for `Simple`
           but trait `HasConstraint<PrimaryKeyK>` is implemented for it
   = help: for that trait implementation, expected `PrimaryKeyK`, found `drizzle::core::ForeignKeyK`
note: required by a bound in `requires_fk_constraint`
