   = help: the trait `Compatible<drizzle::sqlite::types::Text>` is not implemented for `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer`
   = note: compatible types include: integers with integers/floats, text with text/varchar, and any type with itself
   = help: the following other types implement trait `Compatible<Rhs>`:
             `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer` implements `Compatible<Placeholder>`
             `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer` implements `Compatible<drizzle::sqlite::types::Any>`
             `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer` implements `Compatible<drizzle::sqlite::types::Numeric>`
             `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer` implements `Compatible<drizzle::sqlite::types::Real>`
             `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer` implements `Compatible`
   = note: required for `&str` to implement `drizzle_core::bind::BindValue<'_, SQLiteValue<'_>, drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer>`
note: required by a bound in `TypedPlaceholder::<T>::bind`
