   = help: the trait `Compatible<drizzle::sqlite::types::Text>` is not implemented for `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer`
   = note: compatible types include: integers with integers/floats, text with text/varchar, and any type with itself

             `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer` implements `Compatible<Placeholder>`
             `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer` implements `Compatible<drizzle::sqlite::types::Any>`
             `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer` implements `Compatible<drizzle::sqlite::types::Numeric>`
             `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer` implements `Compatible<drizzle::sqlite::types::Real>`
             `drizzle::sqlite::types::Integer` implements `Compatible`
